This repo is for experimental unoffical packaging of cabal-install for Fedora:
typically newer versions than current Haskell Platform and the Fedora package.

The build is statically linked against Haskell libraries for portability.

You can find some corresponding builds currently in
<https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/petersen/cabal-install>.
